		<description><![CDATA[To keep the securtity, but have this work, you can leverage `~/.ssh/config`, by telling it to use two different `known_hosts` files depending upon where you&#039;re connecting.

To connect, you will use `ssh home` to connect to the home server and `ssh work` to connect to the work server.

First, in `~/.ssh/known_hosts_home`, put the `, ssh-rsa ` for your home server, and in `~/.ssh/known_hosts_work`, put the `, ssh-rsa ` for your work server (or you can leave both files empty, and ssh will write this information the first time, but you should ensure your&#039;re not victim of a man-in-the-middle attack at that moment).

Then, in `~/.ssh/config`, add the following lines:

Host home
    # This is optional:
    User yourusername
    # This is optional, especially if the hostname is resolved by the DNS or by /etc/hosts:
    Hostname 192.168.0.1
    # This is optional, useful only if you use  public/private key authentification (you can generate the keys using ssh-keygen):
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_home
    UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts_home

Host work
    # This is optional:
    User yourusername
    # This is optional, especially if the hostname is resolved by the DNS or by /etc/hosts:
    Hostname 192.168.0.1
    # This is optional, useful only if you use  public/private key authentification (you can generate the keys using ssh-keygen):
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
    UserKnownHostsFile ~/.ssh/known_hosts_work]]></description>
