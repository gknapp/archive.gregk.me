		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for your blog post!  I have been trying to figure out how to use virtual hosts offline because I always used Bridged-Adaptor which relied on DHCP of my wifi network.  This is great.

To make it simpler, I found you can have VirtualBox run a dhcp server in the virtual network. In virtualbox main menue, select preferences (Cmd-,) then Network.  There you will see &quot;Host Only&quot; window.  If nothing is there, click little icon on right to create.  Select the little screw driver icon and you can then turn on dhcp server.
That is of course far simpler than the manual configuration.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for an easy to follow tutorial.

I am having some trouble with my setup though. My guest is not seeing my host and vice versa. Pinging my host returns &quot;Destination host unreachable&quot;.

I followed all your instructions. I left my VBs built-in dhcp server enabled, but changed the ip range to 192.168.0.0. 

My ubuntu guest servers interfaces file looks like this:

# The loopback network interface
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

# The primary network interface
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.0.131
netmask 255.255.255.0
network 192.168.0.0
broadcast 192.168.0.255

When I run ifconfig on my guest, my eth0 returns an ip range of 10.0.2.*. My eth1 is set correctly to 192.168.0.131. I am not sure if this is what&#039;s affecting communication between my guest and host. I am also not sure what I need to configure for my host which is a MAC.

Any help would be much appreciated.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I came to this page because I want to be able to take my Mac off-grid and work on a webserver app on Ubuntu guest and run the browser on my Mac. 

So far so good, the host-only network works nicely. My only issue is that after doing the setup, my shared folder stopped working. I&#039;m trying to sort it out now, will report back here if/when I figure it out.]]></description>
