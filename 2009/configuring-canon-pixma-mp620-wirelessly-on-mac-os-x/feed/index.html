		<description><![CDATA[Hi Greg
Thanks for the hints - the magic word was CUPS drivers. I had to install them after the upgrade of an old Mac Mini 2007 to OS X 10.6, which made the previous drivers obsolete, and there was no automated help (OS X search for new software did not find anything from Canon).
Anyway, now the WiFi connection works.
Yours truly

P.S. Snowboarder in St. Albans?! Wow.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had to connect with USB again and fire up Canon&#039;s IJ network tool on my wife&#039;s laptop to update the wireless networking settings after moving house. Once a year I&#039;m reminded how retarded the networking software is on this printer.

Glad this post was useful for others.]]></description>
