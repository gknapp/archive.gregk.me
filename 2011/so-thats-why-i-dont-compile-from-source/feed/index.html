		<description><![CDATA[Just ran into some similar issues (building from scratch on MacOSX, so no apt-get help) and thought I&#039;d pass along the libt1 details I found (and successfully used to build php-fpm from php-5.4.15 sources.

- Dug up http://www.t1lib.org/ through some searches. (Was very annoyed about how obvious that URL was after the fact.)
- That linked to ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/graphics/ which then had a t1lib-5.1.2.tar.gz available
- unzip; ./configure;make;make install and all was happy]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi, thanks for your post, but hey, everybody says you&#039;re saving them time and I find my self in a similar position as you, that is, I got to the &quot;configure: error: Your t1lib distribution is not installed correctly. Please reinstall it.&quot; part, with no clues on how to solve it. I faced almost every other error you listed and had to upgrade lots of other stuff. What I&#039;m trying to do is compile php5.4.10 to work with MAMP. They do not yet provide the correct sources, otherwise, it would be easy. The version number of their server components is behind the actual server and so are the php version in the components. So I download the source directly from php.net and compiled all the depencies up the point where t1lib doesn&#039;t seem to be correct. However, macports can clean and reinstall t1lib without reporting any problems. The error remains. Anyone any clues except installing something pre-built? I know I can install Zend Server for example, but I would like to master this compiling from source karma thing.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The irony is I performed this on my Ubuntu VM that I develop on before deploying to this server. Last night I bypassed this compile from source step by upgrading Ubuntu to 10.10 from 10.04 LTS, then I could take the easy route and use the package manager to install PHP-FPM.

I&#039;m saving a chunk of memory running nginx with PHP-FPM vs Apache 2. Now if I can port Wordpress from MySQL to sqlite3 ...]]></description>
